# Build instructions:

## Ubuntu 18.XX:

This is for a clean install with no build software or anything.

First, clone this repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ThatCodingGuy86/UnnamedOS-V2`

Then, CD into the created directory.
`cd UnnamedOS-V2`

Then, to make the build script executable:
`chmod u+x build.sh`

Then, update your packages:
`sudo apt update`

Then, install Make:
`sudo apt install make`

Then, install build-essential (This'll take a bit):
`sudo apt install build-essential`

Then, install mtools:
`sudo apt-get install mtools`
